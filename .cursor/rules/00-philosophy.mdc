patterns: ["src/core/**/*.ts", "src/features/**/*.ts"]

Core Principles:
  - Intent-driven development
  - Type-safe by default
  - Explicit over implicit
  - Composable components
  - Testable by design
  - AI-first documentation
  - Rule-driven development

AI Agent Responsibilities:
  - Read and acknowledge all framework rules
  - Reference specific rules when making decisions
  - Explain how rules influenced choices
  - Inform engineers about rule applications
  - Suggest rule improvements based on experience

Framework Guidelines:
  - Framework development must prioritize AI-human collaboration
  - Every feature must have clear, documented intent
  - Maintain strict type safety throughout
  - Keep the core minimal but extensible
  - Document all design decisions
  - Think in terms of AI-readable patterns
  - Consider both human and AI developers as users

Architecture Decisions:
  - Server-side rendering for initial implementation
  - Component-based for modularity
  - Event sourcing for state management
  - Adapter pattern for persistence
  - Factory pattern for extensibility

Future Considerations:
  - Client-side hydration
  - Component composition
  - Plugin architecture
  - GraphQL integration
  - Real-time capabilities
  - AI development tools
