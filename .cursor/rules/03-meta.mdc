description: AIFrame Meta Development Rules
Guidelines for improving the framework and its development process.

patterns: ["**/*"]

rules:
  - AI agents should suggest improvements to these rules
  - Document all framework enhancement ideas
  - Keep track of development patterns
  - Share insights about AI-human collaboration
  - Update documentation proactively
  - Think about developer experience
  - Consider both AI and human readability

Rule Improvement Process:
  - Identify gaps in current rules
  - Suggest new patterns and practices
  - Add concrete examples
  - Update file references
  - Remove outdated guidelines
  - Clarify ambiguous rules
  - Add context where needed

AI Collaboration Guidelines:
  - Explain reasoning behind suggestions
  - Reference relevant code patterns
  - Share alternative approaches
  - Document edge cases found
  - Suggest test scenarios
  - Improve error messages
  - Enhance type definitions

Framework Evolution:
  - Track feature requests
  - Document breaking changes
  - Plan deprecations carefully
  - Consider backward compatibility
  - Maintain upgrade guides
  - Version rules appropriately

Development Workflow:
  - Use semantic commits
  - Write detailed PR descriptions
  - Update tests with changes
  - Document breaking changes
  - Keep rules in sync with code
  - Review documentation updates
  - Automate commits after significant changes:
    - After implementing a feature
    - After fixing a bug
    - After updating tests
    - After modifying interfaces
    - After adding documentation
    - After refactoring code
    - After updating dependencies

Commit Automation:
  - Commit after each logical change
  - Use semantic commit messages:
    ```
    feat: Add new feature
    fix: Fix specific issue
    docs: Update documentation
    test: Add or modify tests
    refactor: Code improvements
    chore: Dependency updates
    ```
  - Include context in commit messages
  - Reference related issues/PRs
  - Group related changes
  - Keep commits focused
  - Run tests before committing
