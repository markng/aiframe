# Core Concepts

AIFrame is built on several key concepts that make it unique and powerful for AI-human collaboration in web development. This section explains these core concepts and how they work together.

## Intent-Based Architecture

The foundation of AIFrame is its intent-based architecture. Every component explicitly declares its purpose, capabilities, and expected behaviors. This makes it easier for both AI agents and human developers to understand and modify code.

## Components

Components in AIFrame are more than just UI elements. They are self-contained units that combine:
- Intent declarations
- Data structures
- User actions
- Rendering logic
- Business logic

## Server-Side Rendering

AIFrame uses server-side rendering to:
- Improve initial page load performance
- Ensure consistent rendering
- Simplify state management
- Enhance security

## Security Features

Security is built into AIFrame's core with:
- CSRF protection
- Secure session handling
- Input validation
- Output sanitization
- Database security

## AI-Friendly Structure

AIFrame is designed to be easily understood and modified by AI agents:
- Clear code organization
- Explicit intent declarations
- Rich metadata
- Type safety
- Predictable patterns

## Key Principles

1. **Explicit Over Implicit**
   - All component behaviors are explicitly declared
   - No "magic" or hidden functionality
   - Clear data flow and state management

2. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript throughout
   - Strong typing for all components
   - Runtime type checking

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Intent separate from implementation
   - Clear boundaries between components
   - Modular design

4. **Security First**
   - Security built into the framework
   - Safe defaults
   - Automatic protection against common vulnerabilities

5. **AI Collaboration**
   - Designed for AI comprehension
   - Easy to analyze and modify
   - Rich metadata for context
